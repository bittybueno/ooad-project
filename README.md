# Cafe POS System
#### Written by Marissa Bueno

#### Motivation
This project was motivated by endless cups of coffee and a chance to test out what I've
learned in CSCI-4448. My idea behind the system grew out of my frustration with the crowd
that always seems to form at the coffee bar. If customers had a way to watch the
status of their beverages and pastries as they were getting made, visiting coffee shops
would be even more enjoyable.
